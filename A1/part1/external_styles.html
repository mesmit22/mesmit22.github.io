        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello World.  My name is Mark.  I've lived in Louisville, KY for my whole
            life, graduated from Saint Xavier, and enrolled in the University of Louisville.
            Currently, I am attending my last semester as a College of Business Computer Information
            Systems undergrad and hope to have completed my Masters in the next 3 years.  I 
            love animals currently my wife will only allow two pets so we have dogs, but I hope
            to convince her to get more in the near future.  I am also an avid woodcrafter
            I love to make anything from pens to ornaments, bowls to small clocks.  As of right
            now I do not have the space for large clocks, however I am hoping to move my shop
            into a larger area where I will be able to construct grandfather clocks.  Personally
            my interest lies with the traditional style of floor clocks.  I enjoy viewing the intrique
            carvings and admire the painstaking work necessary to bring such a masterpiece to life.
        </p>

                I am also an aspiring developer.  I have worked on many projects ranging
            from creating a library database, maintanence report gathering application, 
            and a web site used by a non-profit organization dedicated to spreading the arts
            in Wisconsin.  
                I enjoy working on projects that challenge me because:
                1. My skills improve.
                2. I experience different approaches to accomplish a task.
                3. I build realtionships with fellow developers.
                4. I feel a sense of accomplishment upon completion.
